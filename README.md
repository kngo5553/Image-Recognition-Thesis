# Thesis - "Research and implementation of image recognition via deep learning"

This repository will contain the code that was created during my Bachelor thesis.

## Summary:

-Code uses keras 2.2 and 2.4.

-2.2 is used in conjunction with plaidml backend for AMD GPU.

-2.4 is used with tensorflow backend for NVIDIA GPU.

-Repository contains code for single layer NN, DNN, and CNN.

-Hyperparameters were coded so they could be adjusted with ease for testing purposes.

-Datasets used are the MNIST database, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. ImageNET may be done if time/resources permits.

-Single layer NN was only tested on MNIST. Both CIFARs only contain DNN and CNN.

## Testing:

o	Number of hidden layers

o	Epochs

o	Batch size

o	Dropout, batch normalisation (ordering of layers too)

o	Activation functions – sigmoid, tanh, relu, softmax

o	Optimisers – learning rate, momentum.

o	Loss functions – cross entropy.
